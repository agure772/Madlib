# Madlib

Not my original work recreated this project to understand how I can take an input and place into any sentence. Also understood how the random function actually works after playing with this project. 


I went ahead and added the text file I created. 

How this works in case you may need a breakdown.

 The word "any" in my code is where the user input will take place in newly created sentence.

Here is the text file I have created showing where I placed all my "any" in the sentence.
